# Wharton Investing Challenge 2024 - Team Investellectuals
> Code to Analyse Stock Behaviour for the Wharton 2024 Investing Competition

- We utilized the Yahoo Finance API to help us analyze stock behavior and market trends. 
- Our parameters were current stock price, short and long momentum, P/E ratio, and market capitalization, all of which helped us analyze our stocks.
- By running this code on the ticker symbols for the list of allowed stocks, we could rank and evaluate stocks (e.g., a lower P/E ratio and higher momentum indicated a stronger stock) as well as graph stock prices over a month.
- This allowed us to visualize how stable the stock is.
- We could efficiently browse through the large list of stocks as opposed to tediously manually searching for data.
